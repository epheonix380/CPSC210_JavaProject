# My Personal Project

## A POS system with inventory management

**What will the application do?**
- Create and store items which can be modified
- Modify said items in their quantity
- Have a record of items going in and out
- View all the items
- Have the ability to "sell" the items
- Have transaction records

**Who will use it?**
- Small shops
- Street Vendors (Probably would require further development into an android app)

**Why is this project of interest to you**
- I noticed that a lot of people here were not using digital systems for item sales and instead still used calculators
and handwritten receipts. So I thought of making a free POS system that was optimized for this market.

**Wish List**
-I wish to be able to setup a shop
-I wish to be able to add items with names and prices to it
-I wish to be able to choose whether to have an inventory system
-I wish to be able to sell items
-I wish to be able to keep track of my sales
