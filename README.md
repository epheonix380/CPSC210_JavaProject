# My Personal Project

## A POS system with inventory management

**What will the application do?**
- Create and store items which can be modified
- Modify said items in their quantity
- Have a record of items going in and out
- View all the items
- Have the ability to "sell" the items
- Have transaction records

**Who will use it?**
- Small shops
- Street Vendors (Probably would require further development into an android app)

**Why is this project of interest to you**
- I noticed that a lot of people here were not using digital systems for item sales and instead still used calculators
and handwritten receipts. So I thought of making a free POS system that was optimized for this market.

**User Story**
-As a user I wish to be able to create a shop
-As a user I wish to be able to add items with names and prices to my shop
-As a user I wish to be able to choose whether to have an inventory system
-As a user I wish to be able to add items in the inventory system
-As a user I wish to be able to add items to a cart
-As a user I wish to be limited by my inventory system so that I don't sell more items than I actually have
-As a user I wish to be able to make a sale with all the items in the cart
-As a user I wish to be able to keep track of my sales

**HOW TO USE**
Since this is designed to be a POS system that is used by sales persons, one has to add a catalogue of items
first before being able to purchase items. The system gets the price of the items from this catalogue and thus
creating the items in the catalogue is the first thing that should be done. Additionally, if the user has chosen
the inventory shop, that means that the program will be keeping track of the inventory of the shop and thus after
creating the catalogue, the inventory needs to be added in order to be able to purchase items.
