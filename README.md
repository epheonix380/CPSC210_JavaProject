# My Personal Project

## A stocks(not the GME kind)/supply management program

What will the application do?
- Create and store items which can be modified
- Modify said items in their quantity
- Have a record of items going in and out
- View all the items
- Have the ability to "sell" the items
- Have transaction records

Who will use it?
- Small shops
- Street Venders

Why is this project of interest to you
- My mother has always wanted to own a coffee shop and I feel like a stock management system is quite necessary if you want accountibility and easy tracking of your goods

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
